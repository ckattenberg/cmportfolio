# Lennon-McCartney

The Lennon-McCartney songwriting partnership was one of the most successful musical cooperations of all time. In the early days of the Beatles, John Lennon and Paul McCartney would often collaborate on songs extensively. They made an agreement that they would both be credited with all songs written by either of them. This is why all Beatles songs written by either Lennon or McCartney are officially credited to "Lennon-McCartney". Later on it became increasingly common for them to write songs separately. 

# Songwriting chemistry



For this course, I will compare Beatles songs written (predominantly) by Paul McCartney to those written (predominantly) by John Lennon. To this end I will create two playlists on Spotify. One playlist for the McCartney songs and one for the Lennon songs. I will use the following webpage: http://www.myrsten.nu/worldnet/beatlesongs.htm as a guide to determine which song was written by whom.
